# Sentimental Analysis of Text Using NLP and Machine Learning

This project performs sentiment analysis using natural language processing (NLP) and machine learning techniques. It classifies input text into sentiments such as **positive**, **negative**, or **neutral**. The implementation uses Python libraries like NLTK, Scikit-learn, and others to build and evaluate a classification model.

## 📌 Features

- Text preprocessing (tokenization, stopword removal, stemming)
- TF-IDF vectorization
- Training and evaluating a Naive Bayes classifier, Random Forest, SVM
- User input for real-time sentiment prediction
- Visualization of evaluation metrics

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## 📌 To-Do
Add support for more ML models (e.g., SVM, Logistic Regression)
Integrate with a web interface using Streamlit or Flask
Use a larger, real-world dataset

## 📄 License
This project is open-source and available under the MIT License.
